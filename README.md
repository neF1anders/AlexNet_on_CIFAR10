# Implementation of AlexNet CNN architecture in CIFAR classification
This project was developed as a homework assignment for the "Neural Networks" course, focusing on the practical application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal was to build and train an AlexNet model for multi-class classification of images, implementing a full deep learning pipeline.

## Dataset
Source: [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Technical Stack
Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Core Framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) & torchvision

Key Libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 

Environment: Local machine with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU acceleration

## Training Results
Training Time: ~20 minutes

Validation Accuracy: 71.16

The experiment was not as successful as i wanted it to be, but all the mistakes and issues were worked out.
